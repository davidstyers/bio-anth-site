question: 'Why Should We Study Biological Anthropology?'
draft: false
answer: 'Studying biological anthropology gives us a better understanding of who we are and where we came from. It teaches us to look at the world differently and helps us understand that the diversity we see today is due to processes that have taken place over millions of years. It shows us that we are more alike as a species than we realize, and our differences should be seen as a sign of success rather than a point of division.'
