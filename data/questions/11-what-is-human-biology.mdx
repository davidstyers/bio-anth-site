question: 'What is Human Biology?'
draft: false
answer: 'Human biology attempts to understand how the human body is changed by forces such as physical environments, nutrition, and cultural influences. Human biology does not only study our ancestors, but also us! For example, some anthropologists are studying the effects of the typical Western diet (highly processed, rich in starch) on our population.'
