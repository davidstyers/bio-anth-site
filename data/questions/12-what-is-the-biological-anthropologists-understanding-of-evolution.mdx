question: "What is the Biological Anthropologist's Understanding of Evolution?"
draft: false
answer: 'In essence, evolution is the change in the characteristics of a species over many generations due to a process called natural selection. Natural selection is a bias in survivability and fertility due to genetic mutation in a species. Evolution does not take a linear path, it is in a constant state of exploration and trial and error.'
