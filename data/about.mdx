This course has been my first and only introduction to the world of anthropology, let alone biological anthropology. I did not have much background on the subject; I essentially started from zero. The experience of foraging into a new subject can be daunting, and I found anthropology no exception to this rule. This does not have to be the case, oftentimes answering the most basic of questions early on can lead to a solid foundation of knowledge.

When starting, I found it troublesome to find answers to elementary questions on the subject without searching through countless web pages, PowerPoints and pouring through the textbook. Thus, for my project, I saw a perfect opportunity to use my newly gained knowledge to create the website I wish I had when I began my journey into anthropology. The premise of Biological Anthropology & Me is simple – it’s a frequently asked questions (FAQ) for newcomers to gain a holistic understanding of the subject. Practically all digital natives are familiar with a FAQ in one way or another. They are the staple of many websites and attempt to answer questions a user may have ahead of time before one has to make a formal inquiry (phone, email, etc.). This allows for efficiency and gives the user a better overall experience.

So then, what would a FAQ for biological anthropology look like? I thought back to the initial questions I had when starting out to answer this question. A definition of anthropology is a great first step, which naturally leads to more questions a newcomer would ask. I attempted to give the user a 30,000-foot view into the world of anthropology, without getting too stuck in the weeds that could potentially overwhelm one. Coupling this with the delicate balance of demonstrating my knowledge led me to my final project. There are thousands of questions that could be on Biological Anthropology & Me, thus room for improvement (perhaps user fielded questions as well?), but the website as it stands does a good job of answering common questions with reasonable detail.

I enjoyed making the website and I hope it can be of use to many. Knowledge is all around us, but the challenge is in finding it at times. I hope my small contribution to mitigating this does not end with me but instead carries on, as will the site.
